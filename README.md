# DataVisFinal

The parameter are the states that have the greatest average price for a pound of honey, the largest total production, and stock prices. This is meant to be interactive as you have to select a button which represents the right answer. Please look at the tableau project that I worked on at the following link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/melanie.qu1712#!/vizhome/honeyproduction_0/Dashboard1?publish=yes.
You might have to run the code in an editor to see the outputs.

Thank you.
